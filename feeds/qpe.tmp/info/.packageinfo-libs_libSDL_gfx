Title: SDL graphics drawing supporting functions

Type: ipkg
Description:   The SDL_gfx library evolved out of the SDL_gfxPrimitives code which
  provided basic drawing routines such as lines, circles or polygons for 
  SDL Surfaces and adding a couple other useful functions for zooming 
  images for example and doing basic image processing on byte arrays.

  The current components of the SDL_gfx library are:
  - Graphic Primitives (SDL_gfxPrimitives.h, SDL_gfxPrimitives.c)
  - Rotozoomer (SDL_rotozoom.h, SDL_rotozoom.c)
  - Framerate control (SDL_framerate.h, SDL_framerate.c)
  - MMX image filters (SDL_imageFilter.h, SDL_imageFilter.c)
  - Custom Blit functions (SDL_gfxBlitFunc.h, SDL_gfxBlitFunc.c)
  - Build-in 8x8 Font (SDL_gfxPrimitives_font.h)
